Purpose: Numerical Methods class at Hofstra U.  This specific class was a requirement by all Engineering, Computer, and Physics Majors and is a fundamental tool used in the field to analyize errors from any given project.

Comments: Optional project which we could use on the final exam.  All assigned algorithms were integrated and completed, resulting with me finishing the final exam within 15 minutes and receiving an A+ on it.

Description: 6+ engineering level error analysis algorithms
